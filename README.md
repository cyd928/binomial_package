# Binomial Package

Create a python package to calculate and visualise binomial distribution

## Getting Started

You will need the following python version and packages to start with:

* Python version: 3.8.0

* Packages: 
	- ```math```
	- ```matplotlib```
	- ```distributions``` (Available to download from the distributions folder)




## About the Package

### Features:

```p```: represent the probability of an event occurring
```n```: represent the size of the distribution

### Methods:

```calculate_mean```: calculate the mean from p and n
```calculate_stdev```: calculate the standard deviation from p and n
```replace_stats_with_data```: update the calculation of mean and stdev from the parent class (Distribution)
```plot_bar```: plot a bar chart of the distribution from the data list
```pdf```: calculate the probability density function for the binomial distribution
``` plot_bar_pdf```: plot the binomial distribution
